That's according to research by the World Resources Institute's Better Buying Lab in conjunction with food chains, marketers and behavioral economists. Westend61/Getty Images By now, you've likely heard the argument to eat less meat for the health of the planet. Heck, even Beyoncé has been pushing this message, dangling the prospect of free concert tickets for life before fans to raise interest in plant-based eating for the environment. But if you're an omnivore starving while staring at a menu, it can be hard for the future of planet Earth to compete with the appeal of a big, juicy burger. &quot;The language for meat, and beef in particular, just sounds so much more delicious,&quot; says Daniel Vennard. And labels like &quot;meat free,&quot; &quot;vegan&quot; and &quot;vegetarian&quot; tend to be turnoffs for consumers. &quot;People don't create positive associations with how it's going to taste and don't feel it's very indulgent.&quot; And that's a real problem for Vennard. As head of the World Resources Institute's Better Buying Lab, it's his job to work with food companies, behavioral economists and marketing experts to find ways to get people to eat more sustainably. Or, as he puts it, to make &quot;this party sound even better than the other party.&quot; Article continues after sponsor message The solution, summarized in a new report from the Better Buying Lab, is this: Focus less on the meat-free or health aspects of plant-based foods — which tend to make consumers feel like they're missing out — and more on their flavor, mouthfeel and provenance, so it's &quot;appealing to the inner food critic within all of us,&quot; Vennard says. This Diet Is Better For the Planet. But Is It Better For You, Too? The Salt This Diet Is Better For the Planet. But Is It Better For You, Too? Now, the goal isn't to get everyone to go vegetarian or vegan — just to choose plant-based options more often. That's because red meat production requires a huge amount of water, land and other resources, and it's responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. By WRI's calculations, if the average person on Earth swapped out 30 percent of the beef, lamb and goat meat they eat in favor of plant-based options, it could achieve half the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture necessary by 2050. &quot;Which is pretty significant,&quot; Vennard says, &quot;because we've learned that agriculture accounts for about 25 percent of the world's global greenhouse gas emissions.&quot; (Actually, WRI hopes that Americans cut back even more than that, while people in other parts of the world, where they eat very little red meat, might increase their consumption.) But the challenge is, how do you get people to make that swap more often? Chew On This For Earth Day: How Our Diets Impact The Planet The Salt Chew On This For Earth Day: How Our Diets Impact The Planet To find out, the Better Buying Lab teamed up with food companies in the U.K. and U.S., including fast-casual chain Panera Bread. The company had a &quot;vegetarian black bean soup&quot; on the menu that was originally labeled as low fat. Customers who tried the soup seemed to like it, but the name didn't seem to encourage a lot of new customers to try it, says Sara Burnett, Panera's vice president for wellness and food policy. &quot; 'Vegetarian' — the word in and of itself — to a lot of folks doesn't sound highly craveable,&quot; Burnett says. So Panera tried out a couple of options to see if it could make that soup sound more scrumptious. When it rebranded the dish as &quot;Cuban black bean soup&quot; in a test at 18 stores in Los Angeles and California's Central Valley, sales went up 13 percent. &quot; 'Cuban', in a lot of folks' minds, when they react to that, they think of a flavor profile,&quot; says Burnett. &quot;They think of a little bit of heat, a little bit of spice, and that makes people hungry.&quot; You Don't Have To Go No-Carb: Instead, Think Slow Carb The Salt You Don't Have To Go No-Carb: Instead, Think Slow Carb A test that Better Buying Lab conducted with Sainsbury's, a major supermarket chain in the U.K., had even more dramatic results. When Sainsbury's rebranded its &quot;meat-free sausage and mash&quot; as &quot;Cumberland-spiced veggie sausage and mash&quot; — a name that evokes a traditional British sausage preparation — sales went up by a whopping 76 percent. Vennard points to previous research suggesting that before ordering, diners tend to create simulations in their mind about what they think a meal will taste like. Even so, &quot;the surprise, for me, was how much of an impact language can have on ordering behavior,&quot; he says. Panera found its results so convincing, Burnett says, that the company is now doing similar name testing for menu items under development. So don't be surprised to see more words like &quot;Tuscan,&quot; &quot;grilled&quot; or &quot;toasted&quot; on Panera menus in the future — &quot;they actually give you a flavor cue,&quot; Burnett says. &quot;It's going to be warm, and it's going to be a little crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside.&quot; Now, you'd be forgiven if you think the idea of using language to make food sound tastier seems fairly obvious. &quot;It's Marketing 101,&quot; says John Stanton, a professor of food marketing at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. But for a long time, he says, vegetarian- and vegan-food makers have been falling short on this basic concept. &quot;They're targeting it to people who want to avoid meat,&quot; Stanton says. But a recent survey shows that only 3 percent of the U.S. population identifies as vegan and only 5 percent as vegetarian. &quot;It's a much bigger market for people who want to engage in delicious.&quot; Eat Your Way To A Healthier Life Eat Your Way To A Healthier Life And the demand is there, says Melanie Zanoza Bartelme, a global food analyst with Mintel, a market research and analysis firm. &quot;Consumers are really looking for easy ways to get more 'good-for-them food' — legumes, nuts and seeds and fruits and vegetables — in their diet,&quot; Bartelme says. But she says Mintel's research suggests that 50 percent of U.S. consumers say plant-based foods out there &quot;need a greater variety of flavors. So it might be that some of these products haven't yet convinced them that they are worth the switch.&quot; Vennard hopes that the strategies that the Better Buying Lab has come up with will help win over more of those consumers. But if that fails?

                   NS1:content=" CMSC435 - Software Engineering DASH BLOG STATUS LINKS COURSE CHRONOLOGY 2019-03-04 What measurable progress on your project marks the start of a new week? Is your team ahead, behind or just on track to win a successful project outcome? How can you tell? What steps will you take this week to ensure you get that win by design, not accident? This part of the semester is the most deadly to a project. It's a point when deadlines seem an awfully long way off, so while we haven't quite figured out what we're going to build, it is easy to deal with confusion by ducking responsibility. And gosh, there are all these pesky deliverables in other classes which we've left on fire. No need to embrace the horror of a timeline here, right? level1 We've given you control over the timeline up until some hard endpoints. By now you have likely figured out that this is both a blessing and a curse. In this class the win results not just from hacking code but hacking timelines. The longer you go without making sound decisions, the less room you will have to maneuver in your design space and the more expensive will be your build, potentially to the point that it will cost more than you have to give. Trust me when I assert that helplessly watching a project auger in after you run out of engineering controls is a very unhappy experience. &quot;Avoidance&quot; is not a practice we teach. Other classes can be hacked by inspecting some rubric and then just mindlessly following directions. Someone else tells you what to do, all you need to do is get your tickets punched along the way. Exchange those chits for a good grade, and we'll tell you you're awesome to boot! This class however is about coming up with the plans - the rubric - and we don't help you learn that by just telling you what to do. Duh. A key objective of the class is to help you learn how to tell when you are getting closer to (or further away from) a desirable outcome. If you can't discern some difference between where you are today and where you were last Monday, then maybe we need ... need what? Plans? Metrics? Storyboards? Draft specs? Research notes? Transcripts of client interviews? Surveys of competing products? Maybe all of the above. This is a deadly time in a project precisely because we're not doing what we are most comfortable with (programming) so we don't feel like we're under the gun to get something &quot;working.&quot; I hope you're starting to realize though that any one decision you make today has far more sweeping impact on the project than any one line of code you write at end of April. Good engineers will understand that the pace of projects feels differently depending on where we are in the process, but that none of it is any less urgent than the rest. Take engineering control now. Try out the stuff we discuss in class. Come up with several design approaches for comparison, and then move forward by selecting one, not just accepting the first one you bump into. And think about how you'll tell next Monday that you're better off that this Monday. 2019-03-01 An overcast end of the week concludes with a general sense of fatigue. We made some progress this week but yeah, we're ready for spring break - it'll come none too soon. Roll up your engineering notes and make sure you leave time this weekend to reflect on where we are, but indeed go have a weekend. Rest up. The new game starts Monday morning. I'll extract and analyze the engagement poll we just concluded in anticipation of some discussion about this metric on Tuesday when we will cover at length the properties of a good requirements document. How do we analyze them and what makes a good one? Effort this week adjusts a few numbers from last time. I wonder whether we'll see any correlation between effort and engagement? What do you think? Is it possible this is the kind of stuff a manager might track if the goal is to ensure the project is moving forward adequately? 02-22 03-01 03-08 03-15 03-22 03-29 04-05 04-12 04-19 04-26 05-03 Team # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs Affordable 8/8 16.3 8/8 44.6 CROWN 7/8 16.8 7/8 23.6 Vote 7/8 7.3 8/8 32.5 Forms 7/8 17.5 7/8 16.5 Connections 0/8 0.0 5/8 9.1 Webcache 6/8 7.6 6/8 14.3 Finally, take a moment of your reflection time this weekend to study the comments offered to you from your team members. How do they perceive you? Is the how you'd have guessed before this exercise? Is there actionable information that will help you up your game? 2019-02-28 Discussion today on requirements expression, and we listed some of the many kinds of questions that might reasonably be answered by our documents no matter what process they are to support. 2019-02-28 This morning I released an engagement survey at our mentors site. (Look under Inquiries-&gt;Polls.) This instrument is intended to give a quick snapshot of how you connect with your class project team. We'll talk more of this in class today, but do please plan on completing this before our usual Friday COB deadline. We're looking for 100 percent participation, and yes, in this kind of instrument, lack of a response is a response. 2019-02-26 Chiefly lab today since there is plenty to talk about. Nice to see team planning meetings get on the calendar this week. 2019-02-24 During your weekend reflection you might think about application of our principles as specifically relates to your team's bootstrapping process. What are the possible gaps in communication? (Plan in advance how to bridge them before the gap opens up wider.) What might become excessively costly? We'd like to find lean ways to reach better outcomes, of course, so here is the balancing act for you: On one hand, we need buy-in and trust in the team; we need to know we're working for genuinely shared goals, and by that we mean more than some program just working. We only get this by building community, not just making flip agreements on which no sensible engineer would base her grade or livelihood. Community is something we only get with meeting face-to-face and sharing. Investing in relationships takes time. (Hint: The Chris Cross courses to which I referred you earlier will address this point.) The sooner you start, the stronger will be your team when you hit the challenges to come. (And there are challenges in your future.) On the other hand, undertaking all project tasks in lock step is the opposite of &quot;lean.&quot; In discussion I have referred to this as the Road Repair Crew Process. (We've all seen crews out doing road repair in summer, and it always seems like there is one worker at a time sweating with a shovel while seven people stand around watching.) Steps that one student would take to solve a problem need not be the same steps we'd take when eight students are tasked. But if that is how you approach your class project then you will solve the problem no sooner than someone doing this alone, and you'll spend eight times what the cost might have been. (That statement isn't strictly true, since with that approach you won't actually be able to finish. These assignments won't realistically fall to a solitary effort.) If you treat teaming as everyone standing around looking at the same task together, then you're doing it wrong. Hmm. Seems like in order to enjoy the value of lean processes you need to invest enough into relationships so you can trust what each of you will do for the others. The reflection I invite is on how to find that sweet spot which balances kinds of communication. What exchanges involve everyone and build community? What tasks can we agree on dividing up so they can be accomplished concurrently? And ... can you do the latter without having done the former? 2019-02-23 Glad to see good initial plans last night on how to proceed. We're off and running. Remember, plan hard build easy. Anyway, some reactions to your documents are now in the repo. Effort this week is probably not representative of group effort overall since we are just starting to get used to the very simple logging practices. Nevertheless we'll keep tracking this over time. Each team has a very strong self interest in getting these numbers right - not lost, not overinflated, just right. 02-22 03-01 03-08 03-15 03-22 03-29 04-05 04-12 04-19 04-26 05-03 Team # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs # hrs Affordable 8/8 16.3 CROWN 7/8 10.8 Vote 7/8 6.8 Forms 7/8 15.5 Connections 0/8 0.0 Webcache 7/8 6.6 2019-02-21 A busy lab day! We went over the log/ticket system and how it is intended to be used, plus the peer mentoring practices. We wrapped up a few loose ends from the Tuesday discussion then switched over to team time as you bootstrap the project. We noted that the late deadline for submitting your Quickstart paper tomorrow night (9PM) is intended to facilitate some team social time in the early evening before the deadline, if possible. Let's start to build relationships that will sustain us through the project. (Yes, pizza can be involved.) Get what you need off your VMs in the next day or so, if you would; I will very shortly shut them down and repurpose the images for use on the class projects. 2019-02-20 The snow day gave me a quick break from meetings so I took the time load data to our mentors site. Feel free to login there and confirm that the teaming and project information looks correct. This is where you can offer mentoring advice each week, and log tickets any time to track your progress and time. There's no harm from your noodling around with this now (or if there is then better I should know about it soon!) We'll talk in class about what are best practices for capturing such data. 2019-02-19 Project tasking is up! See your personal repo folder for the project name and URL for project repository. QUICKSTART ASSIGNMENT: In order to jumpstart project activity, please submit a short feasibility report on your class project. This is your first obligation as a large team. No cover sheet is required on this assignment. Have the report in your new project repo as Word document &quot;feasibility.docx&quot; by 9PM on Friday, the 22nd. (Yes, later in the day than usual.) You are not carving hard decisions in stone with this report; there are no blood oaths. Assertions you make in it can (and almost certainly will) change, but what is not acceptable is that you have no particular plan. This assignment will get you on your way. Proceed as we discussed in class today. Tell us something about the team - your charter, for example. What expectations do you have of one another? How will you make decisions? What is the recourse if someone doesn't live up to an obligation? What do you recognize as your strengths? What gaps might you think would need filling in? (Level of effort here: this is maybe a page to start with though it can grow over time.) Next, clarify what you see as the essence of the project at this point. Your document might reasonably help us understand: what actual you could construct as part of your solution; what you will show objective observers to persuade them you solved the problem; a likely timeline for the major mileposts along the way (and what they are); the chief technical risks facing you at this point, and what you will do to reduce them; the resources you anticipate you'll need (and thus put in your proposal shortly); the process you will likely follow, and how you will ensure you are following it. You're not writing War and Peace here; we seek clarity, not volume. Simple is good. This is a starting point and might be a page or two. If all this does is get you bootstrapped so you come up with better plans the following week then it is a success. You are writing specifically to me in this exercise, and hopefully doing so in a way that demonstrates you are taking strong engineering control of the problem. Finally, include a specific weekly schedule to indicate meeting times outside of class when you will all get together. (As long as you are juggling calendars with one another, then start to collect up times during the week when it would be feasible to have meetings with me too; we will need to start this cycle fairly soon. Put this schedule in your document too, if you can come up with it, or plan on having it available next week.) If this document doesn't change later as you learn more about your problem space, then you've you're probably doing it wrong. In any case, we'll be talking in class about discovery, product definition, risk management and more. Maybe, just maybe, we want you to practice these things in your project, yes? PEER MENTORING: We start a regular obligation that will last through the rest of the semester. Each Friday by 5PM please offer tips to each of your team members about how to up their game on behalf of your project. Do this via the 435 mentoring site. (Log in, go to Advice-&gt;Add and just fill in the blanks. It should update as you go; there is not a separate POST to worry about.) You are speaking to your team member in your comments, not to me. You are not snitching to the boss or reviewing your parters. Use a voice in your writing accordingly. We will discuss in lab some reasonable ways to express points. Later, you will be able to see the anonymized tips of others to you from the prior week, so you can up your game. If you want to work on a better team, then be a better team member and help others do the same. I won't have the mentors site loaded with your data tonight but it should be ready on Wednesday. And this week only we will have it due at 9PM Friday, same time as the feasibility document. 2019-02-19 Discussion today was on requirements discovery and we illustrated the kinds of details that should be pursued during research. If we don't write something down, then it won't get addressed. So we will take engineering control over a problem at the earliest moment, then capture details and write them down carefully. People may disagree over how we address one or another challenge in a domain, but they should not wonder whether we addressed it at all. Some interesting points about Scrimmage 3, which was returned to you today. First, no two teams agreed on what were the most expensive courses. So obviously the process used and decisions made along the way had a great impact on what we came up with. Team-specific comments are in the repo but some common questions I asked were: Did this exclude seats for which there was no corresponding salary entry? How were names in salary guide de-duped? Did this categorize by seats or credits? Different values result, which is it? What is the highest seat price per college? Can we tell? What did you do with instructors who are drawing salary but offering no seats? 2019-02-17 Teamwork is where it's at, and learning how to be an effective team member takes work; it isn't just something that happens by accident. So here are some more personal development tips to help you along on this path. Think about bringing these training courses in as part of your reflection. Go to http://lyndatraining.umd.edu/ and login with your UMD directory ID. Once you are authenticated then you can take any of a variety of courses, and of interest to us now is one on Teamwork Fundamentals. It is a modest investment of your time that will pay off over your career. Here, let's make tonight's advice a two-fer: why not also check out the course on Project Management Mistakes. This cover some basic practices (and gives basic cautions too) which you might find useful as you work on the class project exercise that you will soon discover is due at end of the week. 2019-02-15 Also, the summary of my comments about each submission is now pushed to your group repo (as I should have committed yesterday.) 2019-02-15 As discussed in lab on Thursday, we're settling in to our weekly cycle now, and so closed out this week with the team time necessary to get most of scrimmage 3 roughed out. Give it a burst of effort today then go have a weekend. When you reflect, please make sure you're thinking about what might be the best lessons to take away from these scrimmages. I've made no secret in class about the learning objectives, but these are such small exercises that it would also be easy to just check off some boxes (like this is one of your prior classes) and ease on to other things. Instead, let's get full value as we go forward, shall we? In anticipation of tasking class projects this Tuesday, I've updated the status board to indicate we should be conducting lo-fi demos of your projects no later than first week of April. That's the point by which we need to see activities in order for teams to argue they should win full credit for offering sustained development on class projects (see the timeline details.) This of course implies we have agreed to a project plan well prior to that. Nothing precludes you from doing them earlier, of course. 😇 Anyway ... plan your timeline and life accordingly. 2019-02-14 Lab today. We discussed some of the nuances of the proposals due this morning and reflected on the several alternatives proposed for solving the problem. Even for a small problem like this we see variety in solution approaches. We quickly switched over to team time. Replicating below some of the common points raised in the comments for today's deliverable: You didn't need much to scrape salary data. Open webtools in your typical browser, find the POST that pulls data from the Diamondback server, save the result. Most differences in how teams proposed were in how we apportioned credit load rather than counting seats. Would like to have seen some indication of how to handle the edge cases and data anomalies. For example, how do you plan to handle an instructor appearing in roster but not salary guide and vice versa. Each of these tells something different. How are you handling salary from multiple units. How to handle multiple discussion sections or labs. Note how cover sheet logging worked; we used dependency chain, which in some cases was broken. 2019-02-12 Today we discussed our principles of software engineering, intended to put a natural framework around many sorts of activities we already perhaps informally know are done in the business. Our class projects are about finding ways to try these out for size and understand their effects. We'll know for good, bad or other by May! We also made our best pitch for why we care: the fundamental economic argument in favor of using process-centered development instead of &quot;just building.&quot; 2019-02-10 A new work week before us and the pace quickens. The Seat Quest scrimmage invites you to express a plan for what you will do to solve the problem before you actually solve the problem. This is an awfully small problem in the scheme of things, so it might feel a little odd to not just dive in and do it, but please humor me by taking the planning seriously. I bet you'll get the points I'm trying to make more easily this way, and I especially bet you'll like having done this on the small problem before tackling the class project. And the draft problem statements are posted, so have a look. At the moment, you could end up working on any one of them, so it is worth your while to give each a reality check; improve it now before it becomes your mission statement. (Hmm, big project definitions are released while we are working through the small projects. Are these related in anyway? Could he be trying to tell us something...?) 2019-02-07 Discussion today about the many ways software engineering failures are in fact failures in communication. This informs us on some of the many specific ways we need to ensure communication is done well. Process is how we organize communication activities, and in our coming class we will talk about principles and how they guide us through a process. Also ... group projects 2 and 3 are posted. Have at 'em, have fun. Finally ... sharing some general comments on group project 1, let's have everyone get the value of them and save me typing them many times. Would have been a good idea to set up your servers so they withstood a host reboot. Probably your native installation of Apache2 would do that; not sure the same is true by default with Node or other. Clean up the files in space that could be visible to the outside world via your server. Editor turds, bak files and similar are all juicy spoils to be nabbed by the nefarious outside, and these files often share passwords or pathways to code where it is easier to create an intrusion. Clean 'em up. Same for folder access; turn off directory listings in your servers, don't make it easy for someone to find what's there to be had. Install these in standard places, not personal home directories. You're real by gosh engineers now, and you &quot;own&quot; these hosts; you don't have to install in personal space as accommodation to restrictions of too-big classes where you didn't have permissions to do the right thing. Here we want you to do the right thing! 2019-02-05 Today was a de facto lab day as we illustrated the most basic planning practices in context of the first group project. Along the way we expanded on repository practices and some basics of how we administer our work environments on the VM. We asserted - so far without much support - that software engineering is chiefly an exercise in communication. If so, then to do better SE we need to do better communicating. We'll start to break that down in more detail on Thursday. 2019-02-02 We observe Groundhog Day while reflecting on the startup of our course. We have most of the bootstrap exercises behind us (and so know the most basic practices to follow in the class) and have started reading about process in our support materials. We're repeating the strengths exercise from Thursday, but now in more detail in order to reflect on our strengths. We're finding our superhero powers to bring to the game. Seven scrimmage teams have been formed, and already some have the first group exercise completed. The grade server is up to date with all instruments, and the successful students keep close tabs on it throughout the semester to ensure they are getting best value. We're otherwise relaxing on the weekend while readying ourselves to kick it up a notch in the coming week. Update: nine ten teams formed. 2019-01-31 Lab today put the spotlight squarely on the most important ingredient in a spectacular project: the engaged team member. This is something we will visit many times in the semester, but to kick it off we talked a lot about what strengths you bring to the game. What is your super hero power and how will you use it to advantage your teams? We did a very fast run through of the Gallup Strengths assessment and illustrated how we'd like for you to follow the process in far more detail on your own. This should help you distill those &quot;powers&quot; and start to envision with more precision what professional situations you want to target in the future - ones where you'll be happiest and most productive because you leverage your strengths. Study those materials in detail, run this process on your own and kick off your scrimmage team discussion by comparing notes with one another. What strengths do you have between you? (You might fill in the spreadsheet and check it in to the group repo. It might prove to be enlightening to you, but at least know the starting point so you can compare this with your experiences as you go through the semester.) You should be going through your support materials and reading up on process and process models. You should get your scrimmage team formed and start building relationships. (Go out to grab dinner together. Talk. Get to know one another. Socialize. Compare notes. Think about what projects you'd like to work on.) Investments you make today will pay off tomorrow. Meanwhile: your first scrimmage team obligation is simple: By SOB on the 7th please have your team's assigned VM set up as a web server. Put up something that easily convinces us that it is talking with some kind of database. Ensure your VM itself evidences decent care, maintenance and security. Per conventions for team assignments, please submit a cover sheet, according to the conventions for digital signatures with the template in your group folder. This exercise will serve as a forcing function to get everyone on to a team in some form or other; it will let us practice conventions for projects; and it will be a good opportunity to practice following our &quot;do the right thing&quot; directive. On Tuesday we will start our first top down discussion of what is software engineering, and we will presume you arrive at that class ready to rock. 2019-01-30 Pro tip for those still thinking about getting started on the assignment due tomorrow: We're pretty precise in what we say in directions. Name files (for example) accordingly. I touched up a few names in the repo as I saw them come through but best if they come in correctly in the first place. Same for blanket commit of all files in a folder ... we got some Word temp file turds and similar. Add by decision, not chance. 2019-01-29 We're off and running with first day of class! We spent discussion today setting expectations of one another for the semester. We action items for Thursday and Friday too. The Thursday tasks are as already announced earlier in the blog, the Friday task is as below. Mailtools is a Linux-based system created in 435 last fall. All present 435 students should be able to access this project in our repository at https://vis.cs.umd.edu/svn/projects/mailtools/src (using appropriate SVN tools, of course.) The simple exercise is to have you tell us about the &quot;Space Invader&quot; feature. What was the date of the last update to the space invaders feature, and what was the nature of this change? How many authors did it have and who were they? What was the most complex space invader component (file) based on LOC (lines of code)? (Give its URL and tell both the language it was written in and the line count.) What was the most complex component (file) based on commit churn (i.e. number of commits)? (Give the component's URL and commit history.) What is the timestamp of your initial checkout of the repository above? List each of the above questions followed by your answer in a file &quot;svnfun.txt&quot; and check it into the root folder of your personal repository by COB on 1 February. (Students still on waitlist as of Thursday class should get with me in order to sort out how to do this assignment on time.) (We promised you no mystery about why we do certain exercises. This exercise lets us get on the same page with regard to some basic class practices, makes sure we know how to use Subversion in some simple ways and gives me a base for talking about simplistic metrics in an upcoming discussion.) 2019-01-26 The first assignments are just as posted in December (below). Have your resume, goals statement and Gallup strengths document (they will give you several PDF documents, so we are interested in the one specific to you) checked into the class repository by SOB on Thursday. We are precise in how we craft directions; be precise in how you follow them. Our business is very much about figuring out how to establish success criteria and get details right, so let's practice this from the start. 2018-12-27 A new semester is just around the corner. Here are some tips as we get closer to semester start ... Review our guide on Expectations Management! Please make sure we are all clear about what we're getting into by reviewing the guide Is 435 right for me? Get an early start on the first assignments! Getting these very small tasks out of the way will keep the decks cleared for more interesting things once the semester arrives. Purchase your Clifton Strengths assessment. This skills assessment is for our exercises on team building and is available to you for a student discounted rate of $11.99 from the folks at Gallup: Clifton Strengths Save and study the PDF reports you receive; place the Signature Themes Report (the PDF document which is specific to you) in your Subversion folder (which you will receive first day of semester.) Update your resume. Prepare this as a PDF document. Please only share details with which you are comfortable. We use the content later in sorting out talents for teams and projects, and to figure out early who knows how to follow directions (which is one of the most basic skill sets of our business.) Place this in a PDF document &quot;resume.pdf&quot; in your repository folder as well. Prepare a thoughtful statement of what you want to get out of 435. Craft this as a Word document, and place it in your Subversion folder as file &quot;goals.docx&quot;. In general we judge more than just the payload of your submissions, so please remember that evidence of timeliness, preparation and planning always count. Everything you do reflects on you. Students on the waitlist should plan to attend the class from day one and perform the above assignments in anticipation of being admitted to the section. We can only issue repository credentials to enrolled students, so if (and only if) you are on the waitlist then email the professor with your submissions attached before the deadlines; this will ensure your work is treated as on-time should you be able to add the class later. Pro tip: Commit to success from day one. The best way to get off on the wrong foot is to join us late without having attended, then try to browbeat us into offering credit for assignments that your classmates managed to complete the prior week. Doing so demeans your classmates as it suggests that their planning, participation and timely attention to detail has the same value as not participating or attending to details. We use workmanship on early assignments as part of our decisions on teaming and tasking, so consider seriously what we would have to work with. Overall, exercise of initiative in the interest of quality is rewarded, so pay attention, demonstrate decent critical thinking skills and focus on success from the start. Do that and we'll make the semester worth your while. Assignments On the first day of the semester we will email you information about the class repository which is one of several ways we will communicate this semester. Your first assignments (as above) will be due by SOB on Thursday, January 31st. Copyright © 2017-2019 James M. Purtilo Web Accessibility level2 " />
